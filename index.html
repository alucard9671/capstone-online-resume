    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I've been intrested in IT since I've had a computer to work from. I've always had a mechine infested mind to everything, I've broken and repaired so many of the electronic devices that I know what component goes where and how to program it. I took on programming after I went to a courses in UJ for robotics when I was around 12yrs and older and we got into the programming phase of it and saw the limitless possibilities that could be done just with a few lines of code. </p>
    <p>    
    I'm good with my hands wether its for breaking and/or fixing devices & toys, but with code you just make it better & improve it with each line. I have ambitions of what I want to create and achieve someday. I have constructed the ideas in my mind and I'm ready to make them. I'm still growing which means learning from mistakes, and to be better I will continue to learn more. I need the experience and mentorship to get me through the extra mile just as a track runner needs a coach to improve his form. I want to work in an environment where I can constantly improve and learn new things so I may be able to take the dreams from my pillow and bring them to life.</p>
